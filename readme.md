<h1>P1: Dynamic Web Apps portfolio</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a one page HTML/CSS sample portfolio site with links to all my potential future projects. I have created it in alignment to the deadlines established in CSCI E-15. My intention for this project is to brush up on my HTML/CSS skills and learn the needed workflow. There should be a repository for this project on my local machine, on my remote repo (github), and on my deployment server (DigitalOcean).
