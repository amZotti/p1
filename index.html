      <h2>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
      <p>Hey there! My name is Anthony Zotti and I love self-exploration and learning.
      I was in the Marine Corps for 5 years, then decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science.
      I am currently going to school full time here at Harvard extension, and also trying to
      find a job as a junior Rails developer.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
      <p>There are so many things I don't know that I want to learn. I want to learn more about
      databases, apache, and PHP. I am really excited for this course because for all the skills
      I have I don't really know anything this course is teaching besides basic HTML/CSS and MVC fundamentals.
      The notion of learning completely new systems is exciting to me.
      </p>
      
      <h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
      <p>Firstly: Vim. I love Vim. I was really excited when I learned that this course
      promotes Vim. Actually, i'm writing this in Vim right now! Besides that, I have experience
      with Ruby on Rails and Javascript.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
      <p>Mac</p>
      <h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
      <p>Nope!</p>
